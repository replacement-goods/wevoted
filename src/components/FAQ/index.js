            <h3>How do we know where the money is going?</h3>
            <p>
              We're committed to 100% transparency and we'll post everything on our
              website. But basically your money will be going to run ads targeting
              right-wing politicians running for office.

              We'll make decisions opportunistically with an eye towards maximizing the
              impact at both the national and state levels.

            <h3>Why did you choose to sell these kinds of products?</h3>
            <p>
              The truth is that we chose these kinds of products because they're fairly
              easy to manufacture. Down the road we hope to expand this business into many
              other product categories.

            <h3>You're selling products in plastic bottles, wtf?</h3>
            <p>
              It's true. But hear us out. It's pretty hard to start a project like this
              AND be low impact. To be honest the supply chains aren't really there yet to
              provide eco-friendly packaging for these kinds of products at a cost that
              would make this project viable. We're working on better solutions. First of
              all eco-plastics are super promising but many of the supposedly recyclable
              plastics aren't as they seem. We're exploring lot's of alternatives and all
              we can say is that we'll get better.

            <h3>
              Aren't you hypocrites? Isn't putting more money into politics just going to
              make things worse?
            </h3>
            <p>
              First of all, it's hard to imagine things getting much worse. Second of all,
              all we're doing is fighting fire with fire. Corporate America already
              bankrolls the Right. All we're doing is trying to help fight back. And
              further, if the courts overturned Citizens United and made what we're doing
              illegal we would shut We VotedÂ® down and dance in the streets.

            <h3>Who are you? How can we trust you?</h3>
            <p>
              Fair questions. We are just ordinary pissed off progressives who decided to
              do something. You can follow everything we're doing on our social media
              pages. We'll try to keep everything posted. If you have more questions, ask
              us in the comments and we'll answer.

            <h3>
              Are all household products really engaged in the kind of right wing politics
              that you claim?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes and no. We did a lot of research. First off, Dr. Bronner's (as best we
              can tell) walks on water. But generally all the bigger ones all dirty. Even
              if they claim they're not if you dig into their lobbying efforts and their
              trade organizations they're filthy. But it's not just the companies
              themselves. Their supply chains are dirty. The shipping companies give HUGE
              money to right wing causes. And don't get us started on the packaging
              companies. They might be the worst of all.

            <h3>Isn't this just a drop in the bucket?</h3>
            <p>
              First of all, it doesn't have to be. If we can convince a million people to
              join in on this it will create an earthquake in American politics. And
              that's obviously our goal. But it sure would be nice if the corporations
              that are underwriting all of these terrible politicians got shamed into
              turning off the faucet. We have no illusions about the scale of this
              problem. But it's too important not to try.

            <h3>How is this legal?</h3>
            <p>
              Great question. First of all, it shouldn't be. But it is. We are a
              for-profit California C Corporation. Totally legal. As a company we are
              committed to pouring half of our profits into our super PAC. Totally legal.
              And that super PAC is runs targeted political ads aimed at throwing corrupt
              right-wing monsters out of office. Totally legal. The funny part is that
              we're doing exactly what pretty much every other corporation in America is
              doing... We're just being transparent about it.

            <h3>What the heck do you guys know about making high quality products?</h3>
            <p>
              This is going to really shock you, but most of the companies making soaps
              are using formulations that have been around for a hundred years. For awhile
              companies were using synthetic compounds and weird chemicals in their
              products but that's mostly stopped. The innovative stuff happening in the
              world of soaps and cleaners has to do with using plant extracts like thymol
              which is an extract from the herb thyme. Thymol is used in place of harsh
              alcohols in things like wipes. Anyway, we're synthesizing all natural old
              school formulations with some of these newer plant based additives to make
              some great products. They are simple, high quality and all natural.
