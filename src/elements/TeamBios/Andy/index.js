        Andy is a software engineer and activist who began protesting and organizing in
        his home state of Iowa in the late '90s. He moved to NYC in the spring of 2001 and
        watched the twin towers fall from the window of his Brooklyn apartment - and then
        spent the next few years protesting Bush's unjust wars in the Middle East and the
        country's rapid shift to the right.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has carried his passion into his career and worked with organizations trying to
        address climate change, fight inequality and ensure a free press. He has over a
        decade of experience developing across the full stack and is excited to bring that
        to bear on We Voted.
