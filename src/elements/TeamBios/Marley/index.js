        Following the 2016 election, Marley Co-Wrote and Produced the 2018 hit-documentary
        Active Measures, which, through its use of exclusive interviews with Secretary
        Clinton, Senator John McCain and other high-profile national-security officials
        and world leaders, tells the story of the Kremlin’s attack on Democracy globally,
        culminating in the 2016 U.S. election. Currently, she has several film projects
