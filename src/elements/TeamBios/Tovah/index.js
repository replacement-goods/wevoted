        Tovah is midwesterner, born to a couple of very staunch democrats. She grew up
        attending political rallies, being taught “justice for all” and falling deeply in
        love with democratic principles. After completing dual degrees in
        Journalism/Strategic Communications and Psychology at the University of Kansas
        with honors, she made her way to Los Angeles, where she has found herself a serial
        entrepreneur. With more than a decade of experience in building digital media and
        sales organizations to millions in revenue, she is ecstatic to now be teamed with
        incredibly passionate people, creating a business that lives its values. Tovah’s
        dream is to help make We Voted a revolutionary household name; breaking the
        vicious consumer cycle; ending the current reign of terror, and changing the
        landscape of American politics forever.
