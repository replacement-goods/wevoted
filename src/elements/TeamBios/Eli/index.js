        Eli was inspired in 2007 by then candidate Obama to do something of service to
        help his country and the world. Nearly twelve years later he came up with the
        concept for We Voted® on November 10th, 2018 while he was sitting in a hospital
        delivery room staring at his newly born baby daughter.

        He is an experienced and accomplished designer and creative director with stints
        at HBO, Skycatch Inc. and Lipman Creative Agency. He is a graduate of Wesleyan
        University with a degree in multi-media arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        He hopes this project will inspire other people to think about the destructive
        role that corporate political money has played in America. His dream is to build
        We Voted®into a powerful force for progressive reform that pushes government to
        address the existential crisis of climate change.
